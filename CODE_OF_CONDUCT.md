# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This pledge applies regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. When appropriate, maintainers
will communicate reasons for moderation decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers. Please include as much detail as
possible (dates, times, places, and any supporting evidence such as
screenshots or links).

- Preferred contact method: <kirumachi@proton.me>
- Confidential reporting: maintainers will treat reports confidentially to
  the extent possible and will follow any applicable privacy and legal
  obligations.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
Complainants and respondents will be treated with respect throughout the
process.
